# TightWiki-Fork

This project is based on TightWiki (MIT). Original code remains MIT licensed; my modifications are AGPL-3.0.

Originally a spur of the moment thing, I'm currently this fork educationally for teaching software architecture concepts to a private community, notably traditional architecture and backend for frontend (BFF) patterns. This fork is not KISS compliant nor should you expect that given my goal. Futhermore, it is not considered production ready, nor should you expect that either.

The current project structure makes sense when you are building a platform rather than an app: when you have multiple fundamentally different clients, non-trivial domain logic that must be centralized, and a need for clean, long-term separation between presentation concerns and core behavior. Does this project need all of these things? No. 

A fork was more convenient than creating a whole project from scratch. A real full featured platform requires a full featured platform workload... 

The community is on Matrix, and you, the reader, may join. Private rooms are for contributors or paying members; public rooms do not require involvement beyond being respectful and following the code of conduct, but are also largely inactive at this time.
